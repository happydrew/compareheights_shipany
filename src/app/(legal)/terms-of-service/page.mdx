# Terms of Service for NanoEdit

## Introduction and Acceptance

Welcome to **NanoEdit**, the AI photo editing platform available at [https://compareheights.org](https://compareheights.org) (the "Site"). By creating an account, purchasing credits, or using any editing features powered by nano banana ai and Gemini Flash 2.5 models, you agree to be bound by this Terms of Service agreement (the "Terms"). If you do not agree, please discontinue use of the Site and services.

## Description of the Service

NanoEdit provides web-based tooling that lets you upload images, describe desired changes with natural language prompts, and generate edited results using advanced AI models. Features described on the landing page — including template galleries, prompt presets, credit-based usage, and integrations with third-party providers — are part of the "Service".

We may improve, modify, or discontinue any part of the Service, including specific templates, models, or pricing tiers, at any time with or without notice.

## Eligibility and Accounts

1. **Account Creation**: Some functionality requires an account. You must provide accurate information and keep your credentials secure.
2. **Minimum Age**: You represent that you are at least 13 years old (or the age of digital consent in your jurisdiction) and have the authority to accept these Terms.
3. **Account Security**: You are responsible for activities under your account. Notify us immediately at [support@compareheights.org](mailto:support@compareheights.org) if you suspect unauthorized access.

## Credits, Plans, and Payments

- **Credit System**: Editing tasks consume credits. Credits may be granted on signup, purchased through pricing plans, or earned via promotions. Credit balances are viewable under your account dashboard.
- **Purchases**: Prices, subscription intervals, and bundled credits follow the information published on the pricing page. All fees are non-refundable unless required by applicable law.
- **Renewals**: Subscription plans renew automatically unless canceled before the renewal date. Canceling prevents future charges but does not refund past payments.
- **Taxes**: Prices exclude taxes unless stated otherwise. You are responsible for applicable taxes.

## Acceptable Use

You agree to use NanoEdit lawfully and respectfully. You will not:

- Upload or generate content that is illegal, abusive, infringing, or violates privacy rights.
- Attempt to reverse engineer, disrupt, or degrade the Service or underlying models.
- Circumvent credit limits, rate limits, or security measures.
- Resell, redistribute, or white-label the Service without written permission.

We may suspend or terminate accounts that violate these requirements.

## User Content and Generated Results

- **Ownership**: You retain rights to the images you upload. By uploading, you grant NanoEdit a limited license to process the content for the purpose of providing the Service.
- **Output**: Subject to the rights of underlying model providers, you may use generated images for personal or commercial projects. You are responsible for ensuring outputs comply with applicable laws and third-party rights.
- **Feedback**: Suggestions or feedback you share may be used to improve NanoEdit without obligation to you.

## Third-Party Services

The Service integrates with third-party vendors (e.g., nano banana ai, Google Gemini, payment processors, hosting, analytics). Those services are subject to their own terms. NanoEdit is not responsible for losses caused by third-party platforms but works to maintain secure, compliant integrations.

## Privacy

Your use of NanoEdit is also governed by our [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy), which describes how we collect, use, and safeguard personal data, prompts, and generated results.

## Service Availability and Support

NanoEdit strives to keep the Service available, but uninterrupted access is not guaranteed. Maintenance, outages, or rate limits may occur. Limited customer support is available via [support@compareheights.org](mailto:support@compareheights.org).

## Disclaimers

The Service is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. To the fullest extent permitted by law, NanoEdit disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. We do not guarantee that model outputs will meet your expectations or be free from bias or inaccuracies.

## Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by law, NanoEdit, its affiliates, and licensors are not liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or data arising from your use of the Service. Our aggregate liability for claims under these Terms will not exceed the greater of (a) the amount you paid to NanoEdit in the three months preceding the claim or (b) USD $50.

## Indemnification

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless NanoEdit, its affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents from claims, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorney fees) arising from your use of the Service, your content, or your violation of these Terms.

## Governing Law and Disputes

These Terms are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction where NanoEdit operates, without regard to conflict-of-law principles. Any dispute will be resolved through binding arbitration or competent courts located in that jurisdiction, unless local laws require otherwise.

## Changes to the Terms

We may update these Terms from time to time to reflect changes in the Service, legal requirements, or business practices. Updates take effect when posted on [https://compareheights.org/terms-of-service](https://compareheights.org/terms-of-service). Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.

# Terms of Service for CompareHeights

## Introduction and Acceptance

Welcome to **CompareHeights**, the height comparison tool available at [https://compareheights.org](https://compareheights.org) (the "Site"). By creating an account, saving projects, uploading custom characters, or using any features of our height comparison platform, you agree to be bound by this Terms of Service agreement (the "Terms"). If you do not agree, please discontinue use of the Site and services.

## Description of the Service

CompareHeights provides a web-based height comparison tool that lets you visually compare the heights of celebrities, anime characters, historical figures, and custom individuals. Features described on the platform — including character database access, custom image uploads, project saving and sharing, chart customization, and export capabilities — are part of the "Service".

We may improve, modify, or discontinue any part of the Service, including specific features, database entries, or subscription tiers, at any time with or without notice.

## Eligibility and Accounts

1. **Account Creation**: Some functionality (such as saving projects and uploading custom characters) requires an account. You must provide accurate information and keep your credentials secure.
2. **Minimum Age**: You represent that you are at least 13 years old (or the age of digital consent in your jurisdiction) and have the authority to accept these Terms.
3. **Account Security**: You are responsible for activities under your account. Notify us immediately at [drewgrant616@gmail.com](mailto:drewgrant616@gmail.com) if you suspect unauthorized access.

## Plans and Payments

- **Free Features**: Basic height comparison features are available for free, including character database access, chart creation, and export capabilities.
- **Premium Features**: Advanced features may require a subscription or payment. Details are available on the pricing page.
- **Purchases**: Prices, subscription intervals, and included features follow the information published on the pricing page. All fees are non-refundable unless required by applicable law.
- **Renewals**: Subscription plans renew automatically unless canceled before the renewal date. Canceling prevents future charges but does not refund past payments.
- **Taxes**: Prices exclude taxes unless stated otherwise. You are responsible for applicable taxes.

## Acceptable Use

You agree to use CompareHeights lawfully and respectfully. You will not:

- Upload content that is illegal, abusive, infringing, violates privacy rights, or contains explicit or harmful material.
- Attempt to reverse engineer, disrupt, or degrade the Service or its infrastructure.
- Circumvent usage limits, storage quotas, or security measures.
- Use the Service to harass, defame, or impersonate others.
- Resell, redistribute, or white-label the Service without written permission.
- Scrape or extract data from our character database for commercial purposes.

We may suspend or terminate accounts that violate these requirements.

## User Content and Generated Results

- **Custom Character Uploads**: You retain rights to the images you upload for custom characters. By uploading, you grant CompareHeights a limited license to store and display the content for the purpose of providing the Service.
- **Height Comparison Charts**: You own the height comparison charts you create. You may use them for personal or commercial projects.
- **Shared Projects**: When you share a project publicly, you grant other users the ability to view that comparison. You can delete or make projects private at any time.
- **Feedback**: Suggestions or feedback you share may be used to improve CompareHeights without obligation to you.

## Third-Party Services

The Service integrates with third-party vendors (e.g., authentication providers, cloud storage, payment processors, hosting, analytics). Those services are subject to their own terms. CompareHeights is not responsible for losses caused by third-party platforms but works to maintain secure, compliant integrations.

## Privacy

Your use of CompareHeights is also governed by our [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy), which describes how we collect, use, and safeguard personal data, uploaded images, and project information.

## Service Availability and Support

CompareHeights strives to keep the Service available, but uninterrupted access is not guaranteed. Maintenance, outages, or technical issues may occur. Customer support is available via [drewgrant616@gmail.com](mailto:drewgrant616@gmail.com).

## Disclaimers

The Service is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. To the fullest extent permitted by law, CompareHeights disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

We strive to provide accurate height data from reliable sources, but we do not guarantee the accuracy of all measurements in our database. Height information is provided for entertainment and educational purposes.

## Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by law, CompareHeights, its affiliates, and licensors are not liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or data arising from your use of the Service. Our aggregate liability for claims under these Terms will not exceed the greater of (a) the amount you paid to CompareHeights in the three months preceding the claim or (b) USD $50.

## Indemnification

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless CompareHeights, its affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents from claims, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorney fees) arising from your use of the Service, your content uploads, or your violation of these Terms.

## Governing Law and Disputes

These Terms are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction where CompareHeights operates, without regard to conflict-of-law principles. Any dispute will be resolved through binding arbitration or competent courts located in that jurisdiction, unless local laws require otherwise.

## Changes to the Terms

We may update these Terms from time to time to reflect changes in the Service, legal requirements, or business practices. Updates take effect when posted on [https://compareheights.org/terms-of-service](https://compareheights.org/terms-of-service). Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.

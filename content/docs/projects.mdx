## What are Projects?

Projects in CompareHeights allow you to save and manage your height comparison charts. Each project stores:

- The characters you've added to the comparison
- Chart title and settings
- Background and styling preferences
- Zoom level and view preferences

## Creating a New Project

There are two ways to create a project:

### From the Projects Page

1. Navigate to **Dashboard > My Projects**
2. Click the **"New Project"** button
3. Enter a project name
4. Click **"Save"**
5. You'll be redirected to the project editor

### From the Comparison Tool

1. Create a height comparison chart on the main tool
2. Click the **"Save Project"** button in the toolbar
3. Enter a project name
4. Click **"Save Project"**

Your chart will be saved with all current settings.

## Project Features

### Viewing Your Projects

Access all your projects at **Dashboard > My Projects**. Each project card displays:

- **Thumbnail**: Preview of your comparison chart
- **Title**: Project name
- **Character Count**: Number of characters in the comparison
- **View Count**: How many times the project has been viewed
- **Last Updated**: When the project was last modified
- **Status Badge**: Public or Private indicator

### Sorting Projects

Use the sort dropdown to organize your projects:

- **Recently Updated** (default): Shows most recently modified projects first
- **Name**: Alphabetical order
- **Most Viewed**: Projects with highest view counts first

### Searching Projects

Use the search bar to find projects by name. Search is real-time and filters as you type.

## Editing Projects

### Edit Project Settings

1. Find your project in the project list
2. Click on the project card or click **"Edit"** from the menu
3. Make changes to your comparison
4. Changes are auto-saved while you work
5. The project thumbnail updates automatically

### Rename a Project

Currently, project names can only be set during creation. Future updates will add rename functionality.

## Sharing Projects

### Copy Share Link

1. Find your project in the project list
2. Click the **three-dot menu** on the project card
3. Select **"Share Link"**
4. The share URL is copied to your clipboard
5. Share this link with anyone to let them view your comparison

**Share Link Format:**

```

3. Select **"Duplicate"**
4. A new project will be created with " (Copy)" appended to the name
5. The duplicated project contains all the same characters and settings

## Project Best Practices

### Naming Conventions

Use descriptive names for easy identification:

- ✅ "Anime Heroes Height Comparison"
- ✅ "NBA Players 2024"
- ✅ "Family Height Chart"
- ❌ "Untitled Project 1"
- ❌ "abc"

### Organization Tips

1. **Use consistent naming**: Group related projects with prefixes (e.g., "Marvel - Avengers", "Marvel - X-Men")
2. **Delete unused projects**: Keep your library clean and within quota limits
3. **Duplicate before experimenting**: Create a copy before making major changes
4. **Regular backups**: Download important comparisons as images

### Performance

For best performance:
- Avoid projects with 100+ characters
- Use optimized images (transparent PNGs recommended)
- Keep file sizes under 2MB per character image

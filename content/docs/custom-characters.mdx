## What are Custom Characters?

Custom Characters allow you to create personalized characters for your height comparisons. You can upload your own images, set custom heights, and reuse them across multiple projects.

**Perfect for:**
- Adding yourself or friends to comparisons
- Including family members in height charts
- Creating original characters (OCs)
- Comparing pets or objects
- Adding fictional characters not in our database

## Creating Custom Characters

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. Navigate to **Dashboard > My Characters**
2. Click the **"Create Character"** button
3. Fill in the required information:
   - **Name**: Give your character a descriptive name
   - **Height**: Enter the height in meters (e.g., 1.75)
   - **Image**: Upload and crop a character image
4. Click **"Create"** to save

### Image Requirements

**Supported Formats:**
- PNG (recommended for transparency)
- JPG/JPEG
- WebP
- GIF (first frame only)

**File Size Limits:**
| Plan | Max Upload Size |
|------|----------------|
| Free | 5MB per image |
| Starter | 10MB per image |
| Premium | 10MB per image |

**Image Recommendations:**
- ✅ Use transparent background PNGs for best results
- ✅ Center the character in the image
- ✅ Full-body images work best for height comparisons
- ✅ High resolution images (at least 500px tall)
- ❌ Avoid heavily cropped or zoomed images
- ❌ Avoid images with lots of background clutter

## Image Cropping Tool

After uploading an image, you'll see the crop and adjust interface:

### Cropping Features

**Crop Box Controls:**
- **Drag the box**: Reposition the crop area
- **Drag corners**: Resize the crop box
- **Maintain aspect ratio**: The crop box adjusts proportionally

**Zoom Controls:**
- **Zoom slider**: Scale the image in/out
- **Mouse wheel**: Quick zoom while hovering over the image
- **Drag image**: Fine-tune position inside the crop area

### Cropping Tips

1. **Center your character**: Make sure the character is centered in the crop box
2. **Include full body**: For accurate height comparisons, include the entire character from head to toe
3. **Remove background**: Crop tightly to remove unnecessary background
4. **Preview before saving**: The saved result matches exactly what you see in the crop box

## Setting Heights

### Height Input

**Supported Units:**
- **Meters** (default): 1.75 m
- **Centimeters**: 175 cm
- **Feet**: 5.74 ft
- **Inches**: 69 in

The system automatically converts between units for consistency.

### Height Guidelines

**Common Height Ranges:**
- Average adult human: 1.5m - 2.0m
- Children: 0.5m - 1.5m
- Basketball players: 1.9m - 2.3m
- Fantasy characters: Any size!

**Tips:**
- Be precise for accurate comparisons
- Use consistent measurement sources
- Round to 2 decimal places (e.g., 1.75 not 1.749832)

## Best Practices

### Image Quality

**For Best Results:**
1. Use high-resolution source images
2. Crop tightly to remove background
3. Use transparent PNGs when possible
4. Ensure the character is well-lit and in focus
5. Avoid blurry or pixelated images

### Naming Conventions

**Good Names:**
- ✅ "John Smith (Dad)"
- ✅ "My OC - Sarah"
- ✅ "Golden Retriever - Max"
- ✅ "Me (2024)"

**Avoid:**
- ❌ "Character 1"
- ❌ "Untitled"
- ❌ "abc"

### Organization

- **Delete unused characters**: Keep your library organized
- **Use descriptive names**: Make characters easy to find
- **Group related characters**: Use naming prefixes (e.g., "Family - Mom", "Family - Dad")
- **Update regularly**: Keep heights current as people grow

## Advanced Tips

### Width Settings (Optional)

You can optionally set a custom width for your character:

- **Auto-calculate** (recommended): Width is calculated from image aspect ratio
- **Custom width**: Manually set width in meters for precise control

**When to use custom width:**
- Comparing very wide or narrow objects
- Creating stylized comparisons
- Matching specific proportions

### Multiple Versions

Create multiple versions of the same character:
- Different outfits or poses
- Different time periods (e.g., "Me - 2020", "Me - 2024")
- Different states (e.g., "Character - Normal", "Character - Transformed")
